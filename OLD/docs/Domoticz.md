Domoticz Beta versions from December 2021 or later support the MQTT Discovery protocol.
As EMS-ESP also fully supports Home Assistant MQTT Discovery this will automatically provide you with all available entities in Domoticz.

EMS-ESP v3.3 provides all entities except the climate controls as read-only devices in Domoticz.
In EMS-ESP v3.4 all entities that can be changed by the user will be available as a settable device in Domoticz.

Check the [BBQKees Wiki](https://bbqkees-electronics.nl/wiki/gateway/domoticz-configuration.html) for the instructions on how to install.
