EMS-ESP can be integrated in Loxone by using the simple Restful API so Loxone can communicate with EMS-ESP via HTTP requests.
Alternatively MQTT can be used but you have to install a Raspberry Pi with Loxberry.

Both methods are described in detail at the [@BBQKees Gateway wiki](https://bbqkees-electronics.nl/wiki/gateway/loxone-configuration.html).
