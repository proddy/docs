title: Response Cache Details

Response caching allows us to reuse response data and avoid repeated requests, thereby reducing response time and saving server resources. Alova supports multi-level caching and two caching modes: **memory mode and restore mode**. Just choose the one that suits your needs.

On the client side, response caching allows users to see data immediately without any delay. On the server side, response data can be cached for a short time to solve the hot key problem.

In addition, using the cache operation API, you can also freely add, modify and delete caches, as well as customize cache matching rules.

Next, let's start with the cache mode!
